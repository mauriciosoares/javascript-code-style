# Javascript Code Style
---
That's my code style for writing consistent and readable Javascript...

It was based on some great code style guides such from [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/).

Feel free to fork and create your own code style!

## Table of Contents
1. [Identation](#indentation)

## <a name='indentation'>Indentation</a>
Use **2** spaces... and never mix spaces and tabs
```javascript
// Bad
if(true) {
    console.log('Uou');
}
// Good
if(true) {
  console.log('Yeah!');
}
```
